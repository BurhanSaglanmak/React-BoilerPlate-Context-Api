# Project Title: ProFuture Website — React & Vite-Based Modern Web Application [(LIVE)](https://profuture-burhan-saglanmak.netlify.app/)

ProFuture is a modern web application built with **React** and bootstrapped using **Vite**.  
It features a scalable **SCSS architecture** and interactive sliders powered by **Swiper**.

# Description:
This project is a comprehensive boilerplate providing a starting point for React applications. Initially, it includes a set of common tools and structures necessary for developing modern React applications.

# Features:

- Context API: Utilizing the React Context API for global state management, ensuring data management across the application.
- React Router: Employing React Router for page routing, enabling navigation and routing structure of the application.
- Material UI: Using Material UI for achieving a modern and user-friendly look. With its ready-to-use components, it facilitates rapid and aesthetically pleasing user interface creation.
- Formik and Yup: Utilizing Formik for forms and Yup for form validation. This combination provides a robust solution for user input and form data validation.
- Header/Footer Structure: The foundational components of the application, such as header and footer components, enabling the overall look and navigation of the application.
- SCSS Structure: Utilizing SCSS for easy management of styles and designs throughout the project, offering a modular and organized style structure.
- Jest Test Structure: Using the Jest testing framework to enhance code quality and reliability. It simplifies the testing of components and functions.
- 404 Page: A custom 404 page is provided for invalid URLs, enhancing the user experience.
  
# Usage:
  - Clone or download the project.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
